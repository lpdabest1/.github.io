My Developer Portfolio
I have been educating and practicing my skills as web developer for the past 6 months as my knowledge has grown do much. I am currently undergoing an internship in order to gain some experience in the full-stack development role. I have a great passion for coding while also being very creative in what I program. I do my own projects as well as projects for RenzoeBox, an ecommerce store focused on cosmetics (makeup)! I hope everyone enjoys and gives feedback on anything that may be an issue with the portfolio.
